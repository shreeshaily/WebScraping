"ThreatsDay Bulletin: Pixel Zero-Click, Redis RCE, China C2s, RAT Ads, Crypto Scams & 15+ Stories","Jan 22, 2026",N/A,N/A,"Most of this week's threats didn't rely on new tricks. They relied on familiar systems behaving exactly as designed, just in the wrong hands. Ordinary files, routine services, and trusted workflows were enough to open doors without forcing them.  What stands out is how little friction attackers now need. Some activity focused on quiet reach and coverage, others on timing and reuse. The emphasis wasn't speed or spectacle, but control gained through scale, patience, and misplaced trust.  The stories below trace where that trust bent, not how it broke. Each item is a small signal of a larger shift, best seen when viewed together.                     Spear-phishing delivers custom backdoor             Operation Nomad Leopard Targets Afghanistan                  Government entities in Afghanistan have been at the receiving end of a spear-phishing campaign dubbed Operation Nomad Leopard that employs bogus administrative documents as decoys to distribute a backdoor named FALSECUB by means o..."
Filling the Most Common Gaps in Google Workspace Security,"Jan 22, 2026",N/A,N/A,"Security teams at agile, fast-growing companies often have the same mandate: secure the business without slowing it down. Most teams inherit a tech stack optimized for breakneck growth, not resilience. In these environments, the security team is the helpdesk, the compliance expert, and the incident response team all rolled into one.  Securing the cloud office in this scenario is all about finding leverage: identifying the strategic control points that drive the most resilience without adding operational overhead.  Google Workspace provides an excellent security foundation, but its native tooling has inherent limitations, and relying on the default configurations can cause headaches. To build a truly resilient program, there are some common-sense first steps teams can take to secure Workspace natively, before intelligently augmenting the platform where its capabilities fall short.  Secure email, the primary attack vector and largest archive  Email remains the most reliable target for ..."
"Malicious PyPI Package Impersonates SymPy, Deploys XMRig Miner on Linux Hosts","Jan 22, 2026",N/A,N/A,"A new malicious package discovered in the Python Package Index (PyPI) has been found to impersonate a popular library for symbolic mathematics to deploy malicious payloads, including a cryptocurrency miner, on Linux hosts.  The package, named sympy-dev , mimics SymPy , replicating the latter's project description verbatim in an attempt to deceive unsuspecting users into thinking that they are downloading a ""development version"" of the library. It has been downloaded over 1,100 times since it was first published on January 17, 2026.  Although the download count is not a reliable yardstick for measuring the number of infections, the figure likely suggests some developers may have fallen victim to the malicious campaign. The package remains available for download as of writing.  According to Socket , the original library has been modified to act as a downloader for an XMRig cryptocurrency miner on compromised systems. The malicious behavior is designed to trigger only when ..."
SmarterMail Auth Bypass Exploited in the Wild Two Days After Patch Release,"Jan 22, 2026",N/A,N/A,"A new security flaw in SmarterTools SmarterMail email software has come under active exploitation in the wild, two days after the release of a patch.  The vulnerability, which currently does not have a CVE identifier, is tracked by watchTowr Labs as WT-2026-0001 . It was patched by SmarterTools on January 15, 2026, with Build 9511 , following responsible disclosure by the exposure management platform on January 8, 2026.  It has been described as an authentication bypass flaw that could allow any user to reset the SmarterMail system administrator password by means of a specially crafted HTTP request to the ""/api/v1/auth/force-reset-password"" endpoint.  ""The kicker of course being that said user is able to use RCE-as-a-feature functions to directly execute OS [operating system] commands,"" watchTowr Labs researchers Piotr Bazydlo and Sina Kheirkhah said.  The problem is rooted in the function ""SmarterMail.Web.Api.AuthenticationController.ForceResetPassword,""..."
Automated FortiGate Attacks Exploit FortiCloud SSO to Alter Firewall Configurations,"Jan 22, 2026",N/A,N/A,"Cybersecurity company Arctic Wolf has warned  of a ""new cluster of automated malicious activity"" that involves unauthorized firewall configuration changes on Fortinet FortiGate devices.  The activity, it said, commenced on January 15, 2026, adding it shares similarities with a December 2025 campaign  in which malicious SSO logins on FortiGate appliances were recorded against the admin account from different hosting providers by exploiting CVE-2025-59718 and CVE-2025-59719.  Both vulnerabilities allow for unauthenticated bypass of SSO login authentication via crafted SAML messages when the FortiCloud single sign-on (SSO) feature is enabled on affected Devices. The shortcomings impact FortiOS, FortiWeb, FortiProxy, and FortiSwitchManager.   ""This activity involved the creation of generic accounts intended for persistence, configuration changes granting VPN access to those accounts, as well as exfiltration of firewall configurations,"" Arctic Wolf said of the developin..."

Webinar: How Smart MSSPs Using AI to Boost Margins with Half the Staff,"Jan 21, 2026",N/A,N/A,"Every managed security provider is chasing the same problem in 2026 — too many alerts, too few analysts, and clients demanding ""CISO-level protection"" at SMB budgets.  The truth? Most MSSPs are running harder, not smarter. And it's breaking their margins. That's where the quiet revolution is happening: AI isn't just writing reports or surfacing risks — it's rebuilding how security services are delivered .  The Shift  Until now, MSSPs scaled by adding people. Each new client meant another analyst, another spreadsheet, another late-night ticket queue.  AI automation flips that model. It handles assessments, benchmarking, and reporting in minutes — freeing your team to focus on strategy, not data entry.  Early adopters are already seeing double-digit margin gains and faster onboarding cycles — without increasing headcount.  Real Proof — Not Theory  When Chad Robinson , CISO at Secure Cyber Defense, applied Cynomi's AI platform, his team stopped drowning in manual checklists. He didn't ju..."
Exposure Assessment Platforms Signal a Shift in Focus,"Jan 21, 2026",N/A,N/A,"Gartner® doesn't create new categories lightly. Generally speaking, a new acronym only emerges when the industry's collective ""to-do list"" has become mathematically impossible to complete. And so it seems that the introduction of the Exposure Assessment Platforms (EAP)  category is a formal admission that traditional Vulnerability Management (VM) is no longer a viable way to secure a modern enterprise.  The shift from the traditional Market Guide for Vulnerability Assessment  to the new Magic Quadrant for EAPs  represents a move away from the ""vulnerability hose"", i.e., the endless stream of CVEs, and toward a model of Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) . To us, this is more than just a change in terminology; it is an attempt to solve the ""Dead End"" paradox that has plagued security teams for a decade.  In the inaugural Magic Quadrant report of this category, Gartner evaluated 20 vendors for their ability to support continuous discovery, ris..."
